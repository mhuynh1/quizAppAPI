new folder
new server.js file
npm init in the root folder //initialize package.json
npm i -s express body-parser

in server.js - - create server
const express = require('express')
const app = express()
const bodyParser = require('body-parser')
app.use(bodyParser.json())
app.use(bodyParser.urlencoded())
/// configure CORS here ///
app.use( (req,res)=>{
    res.send('hi')
})

app.listen(8080, ()=>{
   console.log('api server is running on 8080')
})

server is in separate folder and it can be imported into any existing project of a separate folder

allow CORS bc api call is diff url from where the page originated from

if asked are you familiar with microservices, 
respond with our app's node server was separate from web server as well as ws.
reason we did it was for scalability


bring in mongo
in api folder npm i -s mongodb
create monogodb.js and add in configs
